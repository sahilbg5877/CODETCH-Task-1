# Big Data Analysis with PySpark

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **big data processing** using PySpark. The focus is on analyzing traffic accident data to understand severity, state-wise distribution, and visibility patterns.

## Dataset
- Generated **1,000,000 records** programmatically using PySpark.  
- Columns include:
  - `Severity` (1–4)  
  - `State` (CA, TX, FL, NY)  
  - `Sunrise_Sunset` (Day/Night)  
  - `Visibility_mi` (miles)  

## Tools
- Python 3  
- PySpark  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Analysis Performed
1. Accident counts by severity.  
2. Average visibility by state.  
3. Comparison of visibility during day and night.  
4. Count of high-severity accidents (Severity ≥ 3).  

## Insights
- Most accidents are Severity 2 and 3.  
- States CA and TX have higher accident counts.  
- Night-time accidents occur with lower visibility.  
- PySpark efficiently handles large-scale data, showing its power in distributed computing.
